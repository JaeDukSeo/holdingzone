			<text>Background
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is an established procedure to obtain a pathological specimen

However, histological tissue acquisition of EUS-FNA is not necessarily sufficient

Recently, a newly designed needle has been developed for performing EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB)
