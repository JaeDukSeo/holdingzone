			<notes>Identification of a structure often requires tracing it along its length, and observing its relation to the liver surface and adjacent landmarks. 
We can identify the hepatic veins (HV) by their imperceptible walls, and relatively straight course. Unlike the PV branches, the HV do not have a fibrous sheath, and their walls are thus less reflective. PV radicals have thick hyperechoic walls. The ligaments are thick, hyperechoic structures without a lumen, and extend between vessels and liver capsule.

As the EUS scope is introduced beyond the gastroesophageal junction, the probe usually faces anteriorly towards the left liver lobe if the scope shaft is straight and the knobs are free
(Fig. 1; Fig. S1b–e). In the EUS scanning plane, segment 2 (S2) is closer to the probe (upper in the scan field), and S3
farther away.

Figure: The left liver lobe is usually seen first just below the probe, as imaging is started from the proximal stomach. The diaphragm and cardiac chambers are seen further down in the field. With slight clockwise rotation, 
the left hepatic vein, P2 and P3 are seen.
 S2 is closer to the probe, and S3 further away and down. It is probably best to identify liver segments after rotating over (clockwise or counter-clockwise) the longitudinal landmarks, rather than keeping the scan plane over them. This is counter-intuitive from the conventional radiological learning. The scan plane is usually from the side of the ligaments and veins (tangential planes), and there are no distinct landmarks between the segments, unlike the illustrated anatomy textbooks.
Classically the liver sectors are divided by extrapolating the planes of the hepatic veins over the lower part of the liver- no strict gross anatomical demarcations.

As the EUS scope is introduced beyond the gastroesophageal
junction, the probe usually faces anteriorly towards the left
liver lobe if the scope shaft is straight and the knobs are free
(Fig. 1; Fig. S1b–e). In the EUS scanning plane, segment 2
(S2) is closer to the probe (upper in the scan field), and S3
farther away. The respective PV branches to the left lobe
segments S2 and S3 (henceforth called P2 and P3, respectively)
are seen as round anechoic structures with hyperechoic
margins. With a very slight clockwise rotation over
the left lobe, the left HV is seen as a long vascular channel
coursing from the upper right to the lower left part of the
image (Fig. 2a;Video S1). The plane of the left HV separates
S2 (located posteriorly and superiorly in the left lobe) from
S3 (located more anteriorly and inferiorly in the left lobe).9
To line up the S3 ducts, as for hepaticogastrostomy, the EUS
probe is pushed in with upward tip deflection. S2 ducts are
easier to puncture, but the puncture site is higher, often
transesophageal, with risk of mediastinitis and difficult stent
deployment

In the EUS scanning plane, segment 2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12" color="#000000"&gt;(S2) is closer to the probe (upper in the scan field), and S3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12" color="#000000"&gt;farther away.

With a very slight clockwise rotation over&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12" color="#000000"&gt;the left lobe, the left HV is seen as a long vascular channel&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12" color="#000000"&gt;coursing from the upper right to the lower left part of the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12" color="#000000"&gt;image (Fig. 2a;Video S1).

This  is very helpful to understand left lobe on EUS imaing.
This figure is reverse to  image of abd CT 
Because of direction of Endoscope movement from cranial to caudal, we can imagine this figure.
Endoscope clock-wise rotation like this we can scan left liver, 
Also this CT laterial section is helpful to understand eus imaging of left liver.
Eus probe is facing from post to anterior.
We can take eus imaging of left liver like this.

Figure: By slightly pushing the scope inwards along the liver surface, the ligamentum teres (l.t.) is seen to extend to the inferior liver surface from the umbilical portion of the left PV. This is akin to a flipped trans-abdominal ultrasound image. The hyperechoic ligament does not divide segments longitudinally, but rotation clockwise from this plane would take the scan plane over S4. As can be appreciated, there is no clear demarcation between the liver segments- in this case S3 and S4. However, S4 is best considered clockwise from the umbilical portion of left PV and ligamentum teres, on real time imaging. Because of the scanning direction, S4 and ligamentum teres are seen in the same plane in this static EUS image.
l.t. is the obliterated remnant of the umbilical vein, which carries blood from placenta to the foetus. It is also called round ligament. 
The l.t separates S3 and S4.

With slight further clockwise rotation, the P2 and P3 are seen to converge into an elongated vascular channel with thick hyperechoic walls – the umbilical part (pars-umbilicus) of the left PV. The umbilical part of the left PV describes a smooth arch towards the ligamentum teres (round ligament), which is the remnant of the obliterated fetal umbilical vein (Fig. S2). On EUS, the ligamentum teres is seen as a hyperechoic band extending from the umbilical part of the left PV to the liver surface at the inferior margin of the falciform ligament (Fig. 2b; Video S1).</notes>

In the duodenal fossa, Usually EUS probe contact with inferior or posterior area of liver.
In this point, Here EUS probe can be rotated, we can observe right liver and left liver.
Portal vein is so important landmark for going around each segments of liver. 
If following this portal vein, we can arrive at each segment.

Finding main portal vein and CBD, clockwise rotation lead  probe direction to left liver.
Counterclockwise rotation lead probe to right liver, Seg 5, 8.

Fig. 8. Intrahepatic vascular and biliary anatomy. posterior view. Adapted from Cameron JL, Sandone C. Atlas of gastrointestinal surgery, vol. 1. 2nd edition. Hamilton (ON): BC Decker;

Normal PV anatomy
The PV is formed in the retroperitoneum by the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein behind the neck of the pancreas and courses behind the duodenal bulb. The main PV and the right and left portal veins (LPVs) are in the hilar fissure. The portal bifurcation may be extrahepatic (48% of cases), intrahepatic (26%), or located right at the entrance of the liver (26%) (7,8). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the most common portal venous anatomy. On the right, there are usually two sectoral portal branches (anterior and posterior); on the left, there are two parts to the (main) LPV: the extrahepatic portion [the horizontal part (hp)] and the intrahepatic portion (the umbilical vertical part). In general, the sectoral branch divides into several segmental portal branches, which in turn supply the various segments. One segmental branch usually supplies segments II, VI, and VII and, more rarely, segment III. Segments IV, V, and VIII are commonly supplied by more than one segmental branch. Segmental veins then divide into subsegmental branches, which further divide into small veins leading to the portal venule of the liver acinus (9).


PV variants
Anatomic variants of the PV are uncommon (10-15% of cases) (Figure 3) (10). However, when present, they are important to recognize because they may have profound implications for whether PVE or subsequent resection can be performed successfully. In a small portion (11%) of the population, the PV divides into one left and two right portal branches. This variant, known as portal trifurcation, is present if three branches stem from the main portal trunk: the posterior branch, the anterior branch, and the left main branch (Figure 3B). In addition, the right anterior segment PV may branch from the left main PV (4% of cases), or the left main PV may branch from the right anterior PV. Alternatively, the right posterior branch may stem from the main portal trunk, with the anterior branch forming a bifurcation with the LPV (5% of cases). Quadrifurcation of the PV can also occur, consisting of a branch for segment VII, a branch for segment VI, an anterior branch, and a left main portal branch (LPV) (Figure 3C). In exceptional cases, a branch for subsegment IVb or an additional branch for segments VI, VII, or even VIII may stem from the portal bifurcation. Only very rarely (1% of cases) are bifurcation of the PV completely absent [no right portal vein (RPV)] (Figure 3E) (11). When this occurs, the solitary PV in the hilum passes through the entire liver, either from right to left or from left to right. Failure to recognize this variation in the setting of hilar portal ligation leads to hepatic failure and death. Resection or liver transplantation may require PV resection and reconstruction, which greatly increases the complexity of these procedures (11). Additional variations can occur in both the right and left portal systems. It is extremely important to be aware of portal anomalies because failure to do so can lead to non-target embolization with potential risk to the future liver remnants (FLR).

			<notesNormalized>transuodenal heaptic imaging is to see mainly right liver.
in the duodenal fossa, usually eus probe contact with inferior or posterior area of liver.
in this point, here eus probe can be rotated, we can observe right liver and left liver.
portal vein is so important landmark for going around each segments of liver. 
if following this portal vein, we can arrive at each segment.

finding main portal vein and cbd, clockwise rotation lead probe direction to left liver.
counterclockwise rotation lead probe to right liver, seg 5, 8.

normal pv anatomy
the pv is formed in the retroperitoneum by the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein behind the neck of the pancreas and courses behind the duodenal bulb. the main pv and the right and left portal veins (lpvs) are in the hilar fissure. the portal bifurcation may be extrahepatic (48% of cases), intrahepatic (26%), or located right at the entrance of the liver (26%) (7,8). figures 1 and 2 illustrate the most common portal venous anatomy. on the right, there are usually two sectoral portal branches (anterior and posterior); on the left, there are two parts to the (main) lpv: the extrahepatic portion [the horizontal part (hp)] and the intrahepatic portion (the umbilical vertical part). in general, the sectoral branch divides into several segmental portal branches, which in turn supply the various segments. one segmental branch usually supplies segments ii, vi, and vii and, more rarely, segment iii. segments iv, v, and viii are commonly supplied by more than one segmental branch. segmental veins then divide into subsegmental branches, which further divide into small veins leading to the portal venule of the liver acinus (9).


pv variants
anatomic variants of the pv are uncommon (10-15% of cases) (figure 3) (10). however, when present, they are important to recognize because they may have profound implications for whether pve or subsequent resection can be performed successfully. in a small portion (11%) of the population, the pv divides into one left and two right portal branches. this variant, known as portal trifurcation, is present if three branches stem from the main portal trunk: the posterior branch, the anterior branch, and the left main branch (figure 3b). in addition, the right anterior segment pv may branch from the left main pv (4% of cases), or the left main pv may branch from the right anterior pv. alternatively, the right posterior branch may stem from the main portal trunk, with the anterior branch forming a bifurcation with the lpv (5% of cases). quadrifurcation of the pv can also occur, consisting of a branch for segment vii, a branch for segment vi, an anterior branch, and a left main portal branch (lpv) (figure 3c). in exceptional cases, a branch for subsegment ivb or an additional branch for segments vi, vii, or even viii may stem from the portal bifurcation. only very rarely (1% of cases) are bifurcation of the pv completely absent [no right portal vein (rpv)] (figure 3e) (11). when this occurs, the solitary pv in the hilum passes through the entire liver, either from right to left or from left to right. failure to recognize this variation in the setting of hilar portal ligation leads to hepatic failure and death. resection or liver transplantation may require pv resection and reconstruction, which greatly increases the complexity of these procedures (11). additional variations can occur in both the right and left portal systems. it is extremely important to be aware of portal anomalies because failure to do so can lead to non-target embolization with potential risk to the future liver remnants (flr).

Top figure: The branching of the right portal vein (RPV) into its anterior division (Ant. RPV) and posterior division (Post. RPV) is seen clearly, with the use of Doppler. S5 is close to the probe.

Lower figure: An elongated representation of the right portal vein branches.  Branches of hepatic vein as seen in this section, are usually perpendicular to the portal vein radicals.
Superior aspect of the liver is towards the left of the scan plane, and S8 is seen deep in the scan plane with good imaging conditions. S6 lies behind (posterior) to S5, and is seen down in the scan plane, below S5. However, there is no clear demarcation between S5 and S6.


Normal PV anatomy
The PV is formed in the retroperitoneum by the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein behind the neck of the pancreas and courses behind the duodenal bulb. The main PV and the right and left portal veins (LPVs) are in the hilar fissure. The portal bifurcation may be extrahepatic (48% of cases), intrahepatic (26%), or located right at the entrance of the liver (26%) (7,8). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the most common portal venous anatomy. On the right, there are usually two sectoral portal branches (anterior and posterior); on the left, there are two parts to the (main) LPV: the extrahepatic portion [the horizontal part (hp)] and the intrahepatic portion (the umbilical vertical part). In general, the sectoral branch divides into several segmental portal branches, which in turn supply the various segments. One segmental branch usually supplies segments II, VI, and VII and, more rarely, segment III. Segments IV, V, and VIII are commonly supplied by more than one segmental branch. Segmental veins then divide into subsegmental branches, which further divide into small veins leading to the portal venule of the liver acinus (9).


PV variants
Anatomic variants of the PV are uncommon (10-15% of cases) (Figure 3) (10). However, when present, they are important to recognize because they may have profound implications for whether PVE or subsequent resection can be performed successfully. In a small portion (11%) of the population, the PV divides into one left and two right portal branches. This variant, known as portal trifurcation, is present if three branches stem from the main portal trunk: the posterior branch, the anterior branch, and the left main branch (Figure 3B). In addition, the right anterior segment PV may branch from the left main PV (4% of cases), or the left main PV may branch from the right anterior PV. Alternatively, the right posterior branch may stem from the main portal trunk, with the anterior branch forming a bifurcation with the LPV (5% of cases). Quadrifurcation of the PV can also occur, consisting of a branch for segment VII, a branch for segment VI, an anterior branch, and a left main portal branch (LPV) (Figure 3C). In exceptional cases, a branch for subsegment IVb or an additional branch for segments VI, VII, or even VIII may stem from the portal bifurcation. Only very rarely (1% of cases) are bifurcation of the PV completely absent [no right portal vein (RPV)] (Figure 3E) (11). When this occurs, the solitary PV in the hilum passes through the entire liver, either from right to left or from left to right. Failure to recognize this variation in the setting of hilar portal ligation leads to hepatic failure and death. Resection or liver transplantation may require PV resection and reconstruction, which greatly increases the complexity of these procedures (11). Additional variations can occur in both the right and left portal systems. It is extremely important to be aware of portal anomalies because failure to do so can lead to non-target embolization with potential risk to the future liver remnants (FLR).

Resection or liver transplantation may require PV resection and reconstruction, which greatly increases the complexity of these procedures (11). Additional variations can occur in both the right and left portal systems. It is extremely important to be aware of portal anomalies because failure to do so can lead to non-target embolization with potential risk to the future liver remnants (FLR).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="14"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</notesHtml>

			<notes>The benefit of adding CH to EUS-FNA consists of a better identification of the targeted area in pancreatic lesions.[2] CH-EUS-FNA could decrease the false negative results due to less blood, necrosis, or fibrosis in retrieved samples. Necrosis, vessels, and cystic nonenhanced areas are more easily avoided and the lesion is better delineated with CH-EUS-FNA, so the best area for sampling can be more precisely targeted and with more visibility.[2,15,19]

A few atypical cells, suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma

The negative predictive value of endoscopic ultrasonography fine-needle aspiration is relatively low. To achieve the improvement of the diagnostic yield, the following were proposed: a higher number of passes, the presence of the rapid on-site cytopathologist evaluation, the fanning technique, or the repetition of the fine needle biopsy.

Harmonic contrast-enhanced endosonography may better identify the targeted area in the lesions by avoiding the inside necrosis and the vessels of fibrosis, so it can guide the fine-needle aspiration. Both techniques are complementary, not competitive, and they can be done in the same session. 
The combined technique is simple, safe, and requires only a few minutes with minimal extra costs compared to standard fine-needle aspiration. 
It minimally increases the diagnostic rate, and it permits the decrease of the number of passes. However, we will know its real clinical impact only in the future and whether it will be incorporated into the lesion assessment process.</notes>

			<notes>This slide shows summary of CE-EUS finding of hepatic masses.
Hepatic CE-EUS a little more complex than pancreatic mass.

Washout in HCC tends to be late and often begins later than 90 seconds  after injection of contrast medium, whereas
metastases or ICCs consistently show rapid washout (&lt; 60 seconds)

Benign and malignant lesions can be differentiated in the late phase. 
Malignancy manifests as hypovascularity in this phase, which is the most specific finding, 
while benign liver lesions show isoechogenicity or even hyperechogenicity relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma.</notes>

MRI shows slowly enhanced mass in the liver, S4 segment.

I performed CEEUS 
 aterial phase nodular filling  on the peripheral area
 Portal phase shows hyperenhanced mass

 Typical finding of Hemangioma is nodular enhancement from peripheral to center slowly.

  


To characterize the lesion, the hemodynamic behavior
of SonoVue® enhancement during the arterial phase
(15-30 seconds), portal venous (30-120 seconds) and late
vascular phases (120-300 seconds) was evaluated.

			<notes>This slide shows variable tumors In the liver by CE-EUS, at late phase.
Left side figure wash out state, but still Contrast a little remained.
Lower portion figure also wash out but a little remained.
Middel figure shows storng hypoenhancement at late phase 
Right slide figure still iso or minimal enhancement

Like this each figure represent HCC, cholangio, meta other bening ds
Interestingly, metastatic ds had srong hypoenhancement, important finding suggesting metastatic tumor in GI tumors.




The main criterion for malignancy on CEUS is contrast hypo-enhancement in the late phase, whereas benign lesions typically remain isoenhancing to hyperenhancing in comparison with the surrounding normal liver tissue. Benign entities can reliably be differentiated from each other by carefully scrutinizing the arterial contrast uptake phase; for instance, a globular filling-in pattern is typical for hemangioma and, along with continued late-phase enhancement, is pathognomonic for this diagnosis



Washout in HCC tends to be late and often begins later than 90 seconds  after injection of contrast medium, whereas
metastases or ICCs consistently show rapid washout (&lt; 60 seconds)</notes>

			<text>Limitations of Hepa-EUS 
Still standard imaging of liver segments by EUS not established?
Approach huddle: dome of right liver
Sono equipment 
 conventional transabdominal sono: 3-5 MHz
 EUS: 7 or 10 MHz?
 Image quality depends on sono equipement or company
Need more flexible needle for EUS-FNA of liver lesions

			<notes>•	Detailed evaluation of the liver by EUS is possible.
•	EUS is a dynamic study, and the liver is imaged in variable scan planes.
•	These intrahepatic landmarks can be used for approximation of hepatic segments and lesions.
•	A through understanding of the liver and vessel anatomy by linear EUS will form the backbone of transhepatic EUS-guided therapy, FNB and accurate tumor staging.
•	In the future, reliability, reproducibility, accuracy have to be evaluated


For one case, data on the
effect of EUS-FNA on clinical management were
missing. Overall, EUS-FNA provided a diagnosis in
70% (118/166) of cases, obviated the need for
surgery in 32% (53/166), and upstaged the tumor in
30% (50/166). Of the 118 cases in which EUS-FNA
made the diagnosis, 94% (111/118) were liver metastasis
and 6% (7/118) a primary liver tumor. In 1 case
of pancreatic carcinoma, EUS with EUS-FNA of the
liver negative for malignancy downstaged the tumor
to T4N0M0.</notes>
