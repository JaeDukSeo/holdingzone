			<notes>The 2012 revised Atlanta criteria classifies pancreatic fluid collections as acute or chronic, chronic fluid collections were subdivided into pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN). Pancreatic pseudocysts were defined as well-circumscribed, completely encapsulated fluid collections more than 4 weeks old; surrounded by a nonepithelial wall of fibrous or granulation tissue; homogeneous and without a nonliquid component; and arising as a consequence of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, or pancreatic trauma with pancreatic ductal disruption.</notes>

			<notes>An important step before consideration of drainage is the exclusion of other cystic lesions, such as pancreatic cystic neoplasm. Pancreatic cystic neoplasm often appear morphologically similar to pseudocysts on cross-sectional imaging, and additional evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration of the cyst fluid may be necessary before endoscopic drainage. Pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off necrosis should also be differentiated from acute peripancreatic fluid collections and acute necrotic collections, both of which occur in the acute phase of pancreatitis or necrotizing pancreatitis. These collections have yet to develop an encapsulated, well-defined wall surrounding the fluid collection, and often resolve with expectant management</notes>

			<notes>Endoscopic drainage can be performed using either a transmural or transpapillary technique. Non–EUS-guided transmural drainage requires close proximity of the pseudocyst to the gastrointestinal lumen, as well as endoscopic localization in the form of a visible luminal bulge (Fig. 2). Nowadays EUS is increasingly used to guide transmural drainage. Two randomized trials that compared EUS-guided PPC drainage and conventional endoscopy-guided PPC drainage, demonstrated that EUS-guided drainage is superior to conventional endoscopy-guided drainage in terms of technical success and occurrence of procedure-related adverse events.</notes>

			<notes>Endoscopic transpapillary drainage with placement of a pancreatic duct stent is typically reserved for pseudocysts smaller than 6 cm and with communication to the main pancreatic duct. A combined transmural and transpapillary approach is not typically required for successful resolution of most pancreatic pseudocysts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with PD exploration should be performed concurrent to transmural pseudocyst drainage. PD disruption is associated with an increased severity of pancreatitis, an increased risk of recurrent attacks of pancreatitis and long-term complications, and a decreased rate of peudocyst resolution after drainage. Any PD disruption should be bridged with endoscopic stenting.  </notes>

			<notes>In the first case, EUS-guided drainage for 6 cm sized non viscous pseudocyst was performed with a single-step procedure using a double pigtailed plastic stent only. However, according to Yuan’s study, the 2-step procedure with a double-pigtail stent plus nasocystic drain for 72 hours resulted in a lower infection complication rate and an average of less days of hospitalization compared with single-step approach with only double-pigtail stent insertion for drainage of giant pseudocysts. Hence, the preferred treatment for drainage of huge (larger than 10 cm in in diameter) pancreatic pseudocysts is EUS insertion of 2 double-pigtail stents combined with insertion of a nasocystic external drain.</notes>

			<notes>Coming back to the question, is it time to embrace SEMSs for PPC management? The functional success rate with plastic stents is in excess of 90%, and it will be difficult for SEMSs to significantly
improve on this. The areas where SEMSs may potentially score are ease of placement, fewer early and late infectious adverse events, and better long-term results including lower recurrence rates. Early removal of the FCSEMS may also be possible in patients without ductal communications, thus reducing probability of delayed adverse events. Cost-effectiveness of short-term FCSEMS placement versus
longer-term plastic stent placement will need to be assessed if FCSEMSs show advantages over plastic stents. SEMSs are an exciting addition to the management of symptomatic pseudocyst, but it is too early to discard plastic stents because better evidence is needed.</notes>
