			<notes>For understanding EUS liver anatomy, we need to understand important structure or landmarks.

Large portal vein and HV is good landmark, and Ligaments are LV and Lt. showe hyperechoic lines.
We can see GB and hilum on th inferior surface.





Identification of a structure often requires tracing it along its length, and observing its relation to the liver surface and adjacent landmarks. We can identify the hepatic veins (HV) by their imperceptible walls, and relatively straight course. Unlike the PV branches, the HV do not have a fibrous sheath, and their walls are thus less reflective. PV radicals have thick hyperechoic walls. The ligaments are thick, hyperechoic structures without a lumen, and extend between vessels and liver capsule.

			<notes>As the EUS scope is introduced beyond the gastroesophageal  junction, the probe usually faces anteriorly towards the left liver lobe if the scope shaft is straight and the knobs are free
(Fig. 1; Fig. S1b–e). 
In the EUS scanning plane, segment 2 (S2) is closer to the probe (upper in the scan field), and S3 farther away.

Figure: The left liver lobe is usually seen first just below the probe, as imaging is started from the proximal stomach. The diaphragm and cardiac chambers are seen further down in the field. With slight clockwise rotation, the left hepatic vein, P2 and P3 are seen. S2 is closer to the probe, and S3 further away and down. It is probably best to identify liver segments after rotating over (clockwise or counter-clockwise) the longitudinal landmarks, rather than keeping the scan plane over them. This is counter-intuitive from the conventional radiological learning. The scan plane is usually from the side of the ligaments and veins (tangential planes), and there are no distinct landmarks between the segments, unlike the illustrated anatomy textbooks.
Classically the liver sectors are divided by extrapolating the planes of the hepatic veins over the lower part of the liver- no strict gross anatomical demarcations.

As the EUS scope is introduced beyond the gastroesophageal
junction, the probe usually faces anteriorly towards the left
liver lobe if the scope shaft is straight and the knobs are free
(Fig. 1; Fig. S1b–e). In the EUS scanning plane, segment 2
(S2) is closer to the probe (upper in the scan field), and S3
farther away. The respective PV branches to the left lobe
segments S2 and S3 (henceforth called P2 and P3, respectively)
are seen as round anechoic structures with hyperechoic
margins. With a very slight clockwise rotation over
the left lobe, the left HV is seen as a long vascular channel
coursing from the upper right to the lower left part of the
image (Fig. 2a;Video S1). The plane of the left HV separates
S2 (located posteriorly and superiorly in the left lobe) from
S3 (located more anteriorly and inferiorly in the left lobe).9
To line up the S3 ducts, as for hepaticogastrostomy, the EUS
probe is pushed in with upward tip deflection. S2 ducts are
easier to puncture, but the puncture site is higher, often
transesophageal, with risk of mediastinitis and difficult stent
deployment

the left lobe, the left hv is seen as a long vascular channel
coursing from the upper right to the lower left part of the
image (fig. 2a;video s1). the plane of the left hv separates
s2 (located posteriorly and superiorly in the left lobe) from
s3 (located more anteriorly and inferiorly in the left lobe).9
to line up the s3 ducts, as for hepaticogastrostomy, the eus
probe is pushed in with upward tip deflection. s2 ducts are
easier to puncture, but the puncture site is higher, often
transesophageal, with risk of mediastinitis and difficult stent
deployment

			<notes>Figure: By slightly pushing the scope inwards along the liver surface, the ligamentum teres (l.t.) is seen to extend to the inferior liver surface from the umbilical portion of the left PV. This is akin to a flipped trans-abdominal ultrasound image. The hyperechoic ligament does not divide segments longitudinally, but rotation clockwise from this plane would take the scan plane over S4. As can be appreciated, there is no clear demarcation between the liver segments- in this case S3 and S4. However, S4 is best considered clockwise from the umbilical portion of left PV and ligamentum teres, on real time imaging. Because of the scanning direction, S4 and ligamentum teres are seen in the same plane in this static EUS image.
l.t. is the obliterated remnant of the umbilical vein, which carries blood from placenta to the foetus. It is also called round ligament. 
The l.t separates S3 and S4.

With slight further clockwise rotation, the P2 and P3 are seen to converge into an elongated vascular channel with thick hyperechoic walls – the umbilical part (pars-umbilicus) of the left PV. The umbilical part of the left PV describes a smooth arch towards the ligamentum teres (round ligament), which is the remnant of the obliterated fetal umbilical vein (Fig. S2). On EUS, the ligamentum teres is seen as a hyperechoic band extending from the umbilical part of the left PV to the liver surface at the inferior margin of the falciform ligament (Fig. 2b; Video S1).</notes>

Top figure:The P2 and P3 merge to form left PV. The hyperechoic ligamentum venosum(l.v.) is seen extending to the right of image, and ligament teres (l.t.) /round ligament to the left of the image, from the left PV. Between the probe and the ligamentum venosum is the caudate lobe (S1). S4 is beyond the ligamentum venosum. On the left side of the S1, the fissure for ligamentum venosum separates S2 from S1. However, on EUS we cannot demonstrate S1 and S2 in one plane, unlike trans-abdominal ultrasound scanning.

Bottom figure: The ligamentum venosum (l.v.) is seen as a thick hyperechoic band in this image, and extends upwards to the termination of the left hepatic vein and middle hepatic vein (MHV) in the inferior vena cava, at the superior surface of liver. S1 (caudate lobe) lies between the probe and the ligamentum venosum, and S4 below. Deep to the MHV extends S8. Usually the inadequate echo-penetration does not allow adequate visualization of the S8 parenchyma from the stomach.

l.v. is the obliterated remnant of the ductus venosus, which shunts blood from the umbilical vein to the lung in the foetus, bypassing the liver. l.v. separates S1 and S2. 


Ligamentum venosum is the obliterated ductus venosus,
which shunts blood from the left umbilical vein to the inferior
vena cava (IVC) until birth. It runs from the angle
between the transverse and umbilical part of the left PV to
the IVC at the drainage of the left HV and middle HV. The
ligamentum venosum separates S1 from rest of the liver – S2
to the left and S4 to the front. To the right and posteriorly, the
S1 is bounded by the IVC.10 On transabdominal US, the
ligamentum venosum is demonstrated between the S1 and
S2,11 but the EUS scan plane from the proximal stomach
cannot demonstrate these two segments in one plane.
Instead, on EUS, the ligamentum venosum is seen as a thick
hyperechoic band between S1 under the probe, and S4 deep
to it (Fig. 2c; Fig. S3).</notes>

T

op figure: Slight pushing in of the probe lands it on the hilum of the liver, which is seen in a longitudinal profile. The portal vein (PV) is seen as the superior-most structure from the stomach. The bile duct (not seen in this image) is seen behind the PV, as the scan plane is directed towards the right and forwards (looking from left and behind of the hepato-duodenal ligament). The hepatic artery (HA) and its branches course between and over the bile duct and PV trunk. S4 (Quadrate lobe) is located over the liver hilum. The right PV and right HA dip down on the screen, and cannot be traced further from the stomach. Part of the right lobe (S5) is seen in the lower half of the image, with the globular gallbladder (GB) on its underside.

Bottom figure: Further pushing in of the probe slides it along the liver undersurface now. The scan plane shows the gallbladder GB along the liver undersurface, with S5 on top. We are now scanning from below-upwards.

The hilum of the liver is below and behind S4 and can be
seen by pushing the probe in. The PV trunk is seen in a
longitudinal orientation from the stomach with the bile duct
behind it. The cystic duct is seen below the bile duct and the
GB below and counter-clockwise (to the right anatomically).
A part of S5 may be seen farther in the field below the GB in
patients with optimal scanning conditions (Fig. S6). The transverse part of the left PV rises close to the probe in the
scan plane and can be traced down into the PV trunk at the
hepatic hilum (Fig. 2d). The left HA follows the transverse
part of the left PV and can be traced back to its branches
by counter-clockwise rotation and slight upward tip angulation
(Fig. S7a; Video S1). The right PV branch dips down
almost vertically in this view and cannot be further traced
from the stomach. The right HA also follows the right PV
(Fig. S7b).
Further clockwise rotation from the hilum directs the scan
plane off the liver and the probe now faces the abdominal
aorta posteriorly. At the level of the aortic hiatus, the aorta is
slightly to the left of the midline. The common hepatic artery
(CHA) can be traced from the celiac trunk by rotating back
in a counter-clockwise direction and a little withdrawal
towards the liver hilum. The CHA gives off the right gastric
artery that is usually not seen, and the gastroduodenal artery
(GDA) at the upper part of the pancreatic neck. Variations in
HA anatomy are common12 and can be recognized during the
EUS study. A replaced right HA or CHA is seen best from
the stomach, and can be traced to its origin from the superior
mesenteric artery. During transgastric imaging, the replaced
right HA is seen to course ‘below’ the elongated image of the
PV instead of the normal crossing down from an upward
direction in the scan plane. It is important to recognize this
anomaly before an intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) examination,
as a replaced right HA cannot be seen during IDUS
examination. A replaced left HA can be seen to originate
from the left gastric artery and traced along the left PV into
the hilum.</notes>

from the stomach. the right ha also follows the right pv
(fig. s7b).
further clockwise rotation from the hilum directs the scan
plane off the liver and the probe now faces the abdominal
aorta posteriorly. at the level of the aortic hiatus, the aorta is
slightly to the left of the midline. the common hepatic artery
(cha) can be traced from the celiac trunk by rotating back
in a counter-clockwise direction and a little withdrawal
towards the liver hilum. the cha gives off the right gastric
artery that is usually not seen, and the gastroduodenal artery
(gda) at the upper part of the pancreatic neck. variations in
ha anatomy are common12 and can be recognized during the
eus study. a replaced right ha or cha is seen best from
the stomach, and can be traced to its origin from the superior
mesenteric artery. during transgastric imaging, the replaced
right ha is seen to course ‘below’ the elongated image of the
pv instead of the normal crossing down from an upward
direction in the scan plane. it is important to recognize this
anomaly before an intraductal ultrasound (idus) examination,
as a replaced right ha cannot be seen during idus
examination. a replaced left ha can be seen to originate
from the left gastric artery and traced along the left pv into
the hilum.</notesNormalized>

The portal vein (PV) is seen as the superior-most structure from the stomach. The bile duct (not seen in this image) is seen behind the PV, as the scan plane is directed towards the right and forwards (looking from left and behind of the hepato-duodenal ligament). The hepatic artery (HA) and its branches course between and over the bile duct and PV trunk. S4 (Quadrate lobe) is located over the liver hilum. The right PV and right HA dip down on the screen, and cannot be traced further from the stomach. Part of the right lobe (S5) is seen in the lower half of the image, with the globular gallbladder (GB) on its underside.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="14"&gt;Bottom figure: Further pushing in of the probe slides it along the liver undersurface now.

The cystic duct is seen below the bile duct and the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="14"&gt;GB below and counter-clockwise (to the right anatomically).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="14"&gt;A part of S5 may be seen farther in the field below the GB in&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="14"&gt;patients with optimal scanning conditions (Fig. S6).

			<notes>The bile duct and PV are demonstrated in long axis from
the bulb, with the former closer to the probe. When the PV is
traced upwards to the hilum its bifurcation can be displayed with the right PV branch directed upwards and the left branch downwards in the image (Fig. 3a; Video S2). The
common HA is seen to indent the PV as it crosses it. It then divides into the GDA and the proper hepatic artery (henceforth called the HA) at the superior margin of the pancreatic
head. The HA usually courses along the posterior aspect of the common bile duct in 80% of cases and divides into its right and left branches earlier than the branching of the PV
and bile duct.13 The right HA is thus usually seen in cross section between the bile duct and the PV, indenting these structures. It then passes upwards into the hilum, while the
left HA extends down on the screen (Fig. 3b). The arterial branch to S4 (A4) is variable and has two patterns. It can originate from the left HA near the umbilical portion/ fissure,
best seen by transgastric imaging while tracing the left HA.14 The A4 branch can also arise from the loop of the extrahepatic HA (PHA) as a third branch between the left HA and
right HA, coursing cephalad. This trifurcatingbranch to

When the PV is&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12"&gt;traced upwards to the hilum its bifurcation can be displayed with the right PV branch directed upwards and the left branch downwards in the image (Fig. 3a; Video S2). The&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12"&gt;common HA is seen to indent the PV as it crosses it. It then divides into the GDA and the proper hepatic artery (henceforth called the HA) at the superior margin of the pancreatic&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12"&gt;head. The HA usually courses along the posterior aspect of the common bile duct in 80% of cases and divides into its right and left branches earlier than the branching of the PV&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12"&gt;and bile duct.13 The right HA is thus usually seen in cross section between the bile duct and the PV, indenting these structures. It then passes upwards into the hilum, while the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12"&gt;left HA extends down on the screen (Fig. 3b). The arterial branch to S4 (A4) is variable and has two patterns. It can originate from the left HA near the umbilical portion/ fissure,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12"&gt;best seen by transgastric imaging while tracing the left HA.14 The A4 branch can also arise from the loop of the extrahepatic HA (PHA) as a third branch between the left HA and&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="12"&gt;right HA, coursing cephalad.

Lower figure: An elongated representation of the right portal vein branches.  Branches of hepatic vein as seen in this section, are usually perpendicular to the portal vein radicals.
Superior aspect of the liver is towards the left of the scan plane, and S8 is seen deep in the scan plane with good imaging conditions. S6 lies behind (posterior) to S5, and is seen down in the scan plane, below S5. However, there is no clear demarcation between S5 and S6.


Normal PV anatomy
The PV is formed in the retroperitoneum by the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein behind the neck of the pancreas and courses behind the duodenal bulb. The main PV and the right and left portal veins (LPVs) are in the hilar fissure. The portal bifurcation may be extrahepatic (48% of cases), intrahepatic (26%), or located right at the entrance of the liver (26%) (7,8). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the most common portal venous anatomy. On the right, there are usually two sectoral portal branches (anterior and posterior); on the left, there are two parts to the (main) LPV: the extrahepatic portion [the horizontal part (hp)] and the intrahepatic portion (the umbilical vertical part). In general, the sectoral branch divides into several segmental portal branches, which in turn supply the various segments. One segmental branch usually supplies segments II, VI, and VII and, more rarely, segment III. Segments IV, V, and VIII are commonly supplied by more than one segmental branch. Segmental veins then divide into subsegmental branches, which further divide into small veins leading to the portal venule of the liver acinus (9).


PV variants
Anatomic variants of the PV are uncommon (10-15% of cases) (Figure 3) (10). However, when present, they are important to recognize because they may have profound implications for whether PVE or subsequent resection can be performed successfully. In a small portion (11%) of the population, the PV divides into one left and two right portal branches. This variant, known as portal trifurcation, is present if three branches stem from the main portal trunk: the posterior branch, the anterior branch, and the left main branch (Figure 3B). In addition, the right anterior segment PV may branch from the left main PV (4% of cases), or the left main PV may branch from the right anterior PV. Alternatively, the right posterior branch may stem from the main portal trunk, with the anterior branch forming a bifurcation with the LPV (5% of cases). Quadrifurcation of the PV can also occur, consisting of a branch for segment VII, a branch for segment VI, an anterior branch, and a left main portal branch (LPV) (Figure 3C). In exceptional cases, a branch for subsegment IVb or an additional branch for segments VI, VII, or even VIII may stem from the portal bifurcation. Only very rarely (1% of cases) are bifurcation of the PV completely absent [no right portal vein (RPV)] (Figure 3E) (11). When this occurs, the solitary PV in the hilum passes through the entire liver, either from right to left or from left to right. Failure to recognize this variation in the setting of hilar portal ligation leads to hepatic failure and death. Resection or liver transplantation may require PV resection and reconstruction, which greatly increases the complexity of these procedures (11). Additional variations can occur in both the right and left portal systems. It is extremely important to be aware of portal anomalies because failure to do so can lead to non-target embolization with potential risk to the future liver remnants (FLR).

Resection or liver transplantation may require PV resection and reconstruction, which greatly increases the complexity of these procedures (11). Additional variations can occur in both the right and left portal systems. It is extremely important to be aware of portal anomalies because failure to do so can lead to non-target embolization with potential risk to the future liver remnants (FLR).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="14"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</notesHtml>

			<text>Detailed exam of the liver by EUS is possible.
EUS is a dynamic study, and the liver is imaged in variable scan planes.
These intrahepatic landmarks can be used for approximation of hepatic segments and lesions.
A through understanding of the liver and vessel anatomy by linear EUS will form the backbone of transhepatic EUS-guided therapy, FNB and accurate tumor staging.
In the future, reliability, reproducibility, accuracy have to be evaluated.
